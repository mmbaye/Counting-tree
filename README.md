# Individual Tree Out of Forest Instance Segmentation Without Deep Learning and Dendrometry inference based on UAVs

## abstract
 this a project of counting trees out  out forest without using deep learning for forest inventory 
# Intro
Forest importance
Forests play a critical role in the global carbon cycle, as they absorb and store carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere through the process of photosynthesis. This process helps to mitigate the effects of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, which are a major contributor to climate change. Trees are important for carbon sequestration, as they can sequester large amounts of carbon in their wood, leaves, and roots. The amount of carbon that a tree can sequester depends on its size, species, and age, as well as the availability of water and nutrients. Large, mature trees are generally more efficient at sequestering carbon than younger trees, and some species of trees are more effective at sequestering carbon than others. For example, old-growth forests, which are composed of mature trees that have been growing for many years, can sequester large amounts of carbon in their biomass. In addition to sequestering carbon in their biomass, forests also help to reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations through the process of respiration, in which they release CO2 back into the atmosphere. However, the net effect of forests on atmospheric CO2 concentrations is still positive, as they absorb more CO2 through photosynthesis than they release through respiration. Overall, forests play a vital role in mitigating climate change by sequestering carbon and reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Protecting and restoring forests is an important strategy for addressing the impacts of climate change.
